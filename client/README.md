<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
You must open 2 terminals. CD into the Server directory of the project and Run NPM Start. Open another terminal CD into the Client directory and Run NPM Start. 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

* http://localhost:3000/directory (VIEW THE EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY)
* http://localhost:3000/create (VIEW FORMS TO SUBMIT CUSTOM EMPLOYEE INFORMATION TO DATABASE OR ADD API GENERATED EMPLOYEE TO DATABASE)
* http://localhost:3000/update (VIEW FORM TO UPDATE EMPLOYEE INFORMATION) COLUMN NAMES ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
    "first_name",
	"last_name",
    "picture",
	"job_title",
	"department",
	"start_date",
	"phone_number",
	"email",

<!-- NOTES -->

* REMINDER TO USE TWO TERMINALS (SERVER AND CLIENT) IN ORDER TO RUN PROJECT.

* PRIOR TO WRITING A SINGLE LINE OF CODE I FELT IT APPROPRIATE TO DRAW OUT THE ENTIRE APPLICATION AND PLAN HOW I INTENDED TO BUILD OUT THE EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY, DETERMINE WHAT TOOLS I WOULD USE, AND PROBLEMS I MIGHT ENCOUNTER. THIS ROADMAP WAS CRUCIAL IN ALLOWING ME TO PLAN OUT EACH DAY, SET CHECKPOINTS AND TRACK PROGRESS.

* THE EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY WAS CREATED SERVERSIDE FIRST BECAUSE I KNEW I NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO CREATE EMPLOYEE DATA USING A THIRD PARTY PERSON API(https://randomuser.me), STORE IT, AND MANIPULATE IT. 

* I STARTED BY SETTING UP A SERVER USING EXPRESS WITH A TEST ROUTE '/PING' AND A CONTROLLER 'APICONTROLLER.PING' JUST TO MAKE SURE THINGS WERE WORKING CORRECTLY. POSTMAN WAS USED HEAVILY TO CONFIRM THAT CLIENT SIDE REQUESTS WERE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES FROM THE SERVER SIDE.

* CRUD FUNCTIONALITY IS A BIG PART OF WHAT IS BEING ASKED FOR IN THIS ASSESSMENT SO I USED POSTGRESQL IN ORDER TO BUILD A DATABASE THAT STORED ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEE DATA. 

* ONCE THE DATABASE WAS SETUP I CREATED A ROUTE AND CONTROLLER THAT MADE THE CALL THE THE THIRD PARTY API AND STORED THAT DATA IN THE DATABASE.

* THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS FOUND IN THE  SERVER/ROUTES/API.JS FILE AND SERVER/CONTROLLERS/APICONTROLLER.JS FILE.

* ONCE I HAD ENOUGH EMPLOYEES IN THE DATABASE I FOCUSED ON CRUD FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE DATABASE AND SETUP THE APPROPRIATE ROUTES AND METHODS IN THE SERVER/ROUTES/DATABASE.JS FILE AND SERVER/CONTROLLERS/DATABASECONTROLLER.JS FILE.

* I DID MY BEST TO MAKE THINGS AS EASY TO INTUIT AS POSSIBLE WITH MY NAMING CONVENTION BUT I ALSO LEFT COMMENTS ON EACH ROUTE AND METHOD JUST TO BE AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE WHEN READING THROUGH THE CODE.

* THE FRONT END WAS BUILT USING REACT(create-react-app was used to saved time with webpack) AND AXIOS.

* ONCE THE NECESSARY FUNCTIONALITY WAS WORKING ON THE BACK END I FELT IT WAS TIME TO BUILD REACT ON TOP OF THE BACKEND AND START RENDERING EMPLOYEE DATA.

* I STARTED ON THE FRONT END BY CREATING THE FORMS(in the form of components) I WOULD USE FOR CREATING NEW EMPLOYEES, DELETING EMPLOYEES, AND UPDATING EMPLOYEE INFORMATION.

* EVEN THOUGH THE BACK END METHODS WERE TESTED VIA POSTMAN AND FUNCTIONED CORRECTLY THEY NEEDED TO BE ADJUSTED WHEN THE REQUEST WAS COMING IN FROM THE CLIENT VIA REACT AND NO LONGER FROM POSTMAN.

* WITH THE PROPER ADJUSTMENTS MADE ALL OF CRUD METHODS ARE FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED AND EITHER RENDERING EMPLOYEES ON THE FRONT END OR MAKING THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO THE DIRECTORY DATABASE.

* ONCE THE FORMS WERE COMPLETE I NEEDED TO CREATE TWO MORE COMPONENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO RENDER THE EMPLOYEES IN THE DATABASE. I STARTED WITH THE EMPLOYEECARD COMPONENT IN ORDER TO PASS EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES INFORMATION THAT COULD BE RENDERED AS AN INDIVIDUAL 'STAMP' OF DATA

* THE LAST COMPONENT CREATED WAS THE DIRECTORY COMPONENT WHICH THE CARDS OR "STAMPS" WOULD BE APPLIED TO.  

<!-- SUGGESTED FEATURES COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE  -->

* Ability to display employees by department, title, location, etc. /*INCOMPLETE, FUNCTIONALITY IS THERE ON BACKEND BUT DOES NOT WORK ON FRONT END (TITLE AND DEPARTMENT DROP DOWNS ON DIRECTORY PAGE NON-FUNCTIONAL*/
* Use of a client-side router                                       /*COMPLETE*/

<!-- MY THOUGHTS/WHAT WOULD BE MORE COMPLETE IN THIS PROJECT IN A PRODUCTION ENVIROMENT -->

* FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO THE POST LIGHT TEAM, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOUR TEAM.

* THE STYLING OF THE DIRECTORY AS IS NOW NEEDS ALOT OF WORK BUT I FELT IT MORE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY IS THERE BEFORE WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE AESTHETICS. IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT WHERE THIS APP WOULD BE USED IN THE REAL WORLD, THIS APP WOULD NEED A MAJOR VISUAL OVERHAUL. 

* CLIENT SIDE CACHING TO SAVE CALLS TO DATABASE. 

* TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT USING JEST OR MOCHA WOULD BE NEEDED.

* THE ABILITY TO REFINE THE FILTER ABILITY EVEN FURTHER THAN JUST TITLE OR DEPARTMENT.
